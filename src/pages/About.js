      <p>
        Hi, my name is Camila Moreiras and I'm a full-stack software engineer.
        My background is in film and teaching, which I think lends a nice
        diverse aspect to understanding various code bases and the needs of
        clients. I'm adaptable and dependable, apt at public speaking and
        breaking things down in ways that bring people in to the conversation
        rather than isolate them.
      </p>
    </div>
