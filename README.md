# React Portfolio

This work-in-progress React Portfolio is the capstone of my 6 month journey in learning to code from the ground up. As I navigate my way through UI/UX foundations, I am excited to see that I've come a long way since day 1 (which is why I've linked my first portfolio project in the home page!)Keep checking back, as this isn't the final stage of this portfolio.
